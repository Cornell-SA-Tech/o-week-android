Design Choices
------
 * All objects are presumed to **not be <code>null</code>** when passed into a method as a parameter. If an object can be null, use the annotation <code>@Nullable</code>.
 * Syntax:
   * Tabs > Spaces
   * Put curly braces on a new line, like so:
   ```java
   if (blah)
   {
      doSomething();
      doSomethingElse();
   }
   ```
   * If a statement is singleLine, don't use brackets at all, like so:
   ```java
   if (blah)
      doSomething();
   ```
   * ClassesShouldBeNamedLikeThis, as should enums and interfaces. (upper camel case)
   * methodsShouldBeNamedLikeThis, as should non-static or non-final variables. (lower camel case)
   * STATIC_VARS_SHOULD_BE_NAMED_LIKE_THIS, as should any final variables (or variables whose values shouldn't be changed).
 * **RecyclerView**s are used instead of ListViews. Each RecyclerView should have a separate **Adapter** class and at least 1 **ViewHolder** class (one for each type of cell supported). RecyclerViews are encouraged over ListViews since we don't need to re-find views' IDs when "recycling" them â€“ creating only the number of cells that will appear on screen and changing the data they show when the user scrolls.
 * <code>TAG</code>s are set on the top of some classes for logging. Set up a shortcut to easily create <code>TAG</code>s for classes by following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29378779/4028758">this</a> article.
 * An "Event" can refer to 2 things, judging on context:
   1. An <code>Event</code> that will occur during orientation week.
   2. Something to notify listeners of. For example, a click event.
 
Used Libraries
------
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/guava">Guava</a> - a Google Library containing lots of helpful classes for Java. Most notably, immutable data structures (like ImmutableList) and EventBus, which provides a way for classes that do not have references to each other to communicate.
 * <a href="https://github.com/dlew/joda-time-android">JodaTime</a> - a library for immutable time objects, unsupported by Java 7. Includes lots of useful data structures and methods; plus, immutable objects are almost always safer when passing by reference.
